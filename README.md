# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing an analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project answers two questions:
1. What should be the launch date for a play campaign.
2. How much should be the goal of the campaign.
### Purpose
The purpose of the challenge was to deliever the outcomes based on two factors:
1. Outcomes based on launch date
2. outcomes based on goals
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By looking at the analysis of the outcomes based on launch date:
I conclude that May, June, July are the best months to launch a play campaign as the chart clearly depicts, According to historical Data; May was the most successful month for the play campaign, followed by June and July.
While the worst time to launch a play campaign was in December which has the lowest success Rate and a very high failure rate.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As we look at the chart on outcomes based on goals, it is clear that Play campaigns which had a goal of "9999 to 14999" were 100% successfull, followed by campaigns which had a goal of greater than 50000 and less than 1000, respectively.
while goal between "44999 to 49999" were the most failed followed by goals between "24999 and 34999"
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May, june, july is are the best months to launch a play campaign.
december is the worst month to launch a campaign with a very high failure rate.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
according to the goals data it is very unlikely to conclude a single goal as there are various times where we have reached our goals like, goals between "4999 to 9999", greter than 50000,
however it is very difficult to say which goals we are very likely to achive as it is very random.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
According to the data of outcomes based on goals it is very unlikely to give any fixed number for the goals.
because it is very unclear which goals we are going to achieve and which are not.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
